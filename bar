	One day, as I was leaving my robotics room, the clubâ€™s lead mentor Brian asked me if I was interested in captaining a new FTC team, 23838.  Of course I was- here was an opportunity to inspire newcomers as my captain had inspired me, and to introduce them to skills which they would hopefully get to use the rest of their lives.  Having accepted the invitation, I started meeting with my team of 15 middle schoolers and 2 rookie mentors.
